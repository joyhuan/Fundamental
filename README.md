I absolutely love the first math course I took at Cornell with Professor Ravi Ramakrishna in Fall 2016. In the same semester I took Electromagnetism with Professor Kyle Shen. These two courses absolutely enlightened me. The two amazing professors never taught a course after that semester. I was so drawn to their super charisma that I totally ignored my first CS course -- which is a calculated loss that I am still remedying after three years. 

In the midth of one linear algebra class, Ravi stopped and diverted to talk about how the ln function was introduced.

That was my Epiphany moment. Similarly if you think about the awkward but useful stuff in math -- such as pi, e, and the famous beautiful function Euler'e identity -- they all actually come natually (well, that easiness derives from the mastery of a broad of math concepts and rules). 
 
The two professor challenged me how much you can approach the simplest essence of the world. For that, I don't regret the 20+ hours/class/week I spent at 18.
